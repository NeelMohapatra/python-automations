# Python Automations
Some little automations to help your efficiency because it's about the little
things :)
(Most of these automations will work only on OSX and python3)

### How to use them?
In the terminal, type
```
chmod +x file-name.py
./file-name.py args (if any needed)
```
PS: I would advise creating an alias for the commands because that only makes it easier. Check this link: http://askubuntu.com/questions/17536/how-do-i-create-a-permanent-bash-alias
